# fetch_exercise
This repository is my submission for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise. I used a local MySQL server and MySQLWorkbench for this exercise. I looked up some syntax using the MySQL documentation online.

I was facing slight issues with reading the date tables in the datetime format, hence I uploaded them in the database as a text format and extracted the month where required.

### Problem 1
The image ```relational_diagram.png``` shows the relational data model I have developed for this exercise (I developed it using Adobe Illustrator as I am proficient with graphic designing tools which fuels my interest in data visualization).

### Problem 2
The SQl query files are included in the repository. I was able to do problem 3 and 4 using a single SQl query.

### Problem 3
The image ```noteworthy_trend_from_data.png``` shows a bar chart that highlights how shopping patterns have changed over the 12 months of the year in terms of the average amount customers spend in a single shopping trip. We can see that the average spending in July and August is much more than other months of the year which could mean there is a high probability of customers being willing to spend more (this can be validated using statistical techniques), perhaps on certain products. For Fetch, this presents an opportunity to target more customers in these months to maximize profits. By further examining the type of products customers are buying in these months, Fetch could partner with similar brand categories and put more effort into advertising these over these months.
