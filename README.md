# fetch_exercise
My submission for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise. I used a local MySQL server and MySQLWorkbench for this exercise. I looked up some syntax using the MySQL documentation online.

I was facing slight issues with reading the date tables in the datetime format, hence I uploaded them in the database as a text format and extracted the month where required.
